# Memoizing
"Memoizing" contains 2 separate functions that use memoization to improve the time complexity of the recursive functions.
This program provides a way to efficiently calculate both binomial coefficients and edit distances using recursion and memoization to enhance performance. The binom function is useful for combinatorial problems, while the editDist function is commonly used in applications involving string comparison, such as spell checking, DNA sequence analysis, and natural language processing.
